# Chicago Speed Camera Violations

## Background
Chicago experiences high number of crashes between vehicles and pedestrians, about 25% of which involve children. According to the City of Chicago [[Ref 1]](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/automated_enforcement/news/2018/july/automated-speed-enforcement-cameras-to-be-activated-in-response-.html), “the Children’s Safety Zone Program protects children and other pedestrians by reminding motorists to slow down and obey speed laws – especially in school and park zones.” Safety zones are designated as a 660-foot boundary around any parks or schools. 
According to the City of Chicago [[Ref 1]](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/automated_enforcement/news/2018/july/automated-speed-enforcement-cameras-to-be-activated-in-response-.html), “revenue collected from the program will be utilized for programs that enhance the safety of children, including afterschool, anti-violence and jobs programs; crossing guards and police officers around schools; and infrastructure improvements, such as signs, crosswalk markings and other traffic safety improvements.”

## Trendline and Forecast for Total Violations:
Figure shows that since the installation of automated speed cameras in parks and schools safety zones, total speed violations reported by all cameras are on decline. In general, this can be attributed to a couple of factors: 
1. First, drivers are now more aware of the camera locations and associated violation rules. This is also in accordance with the findings documented in annual report published by the City of Chicago [[Ref 2]](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/Red%20Light%20Cameras/2017_Automated_Enforcement_Report20180427.pdf). It says, “In 2017, 90 percent of drivers that were issued a ticket for speeding in a school zone and 73 percent of drivers that were issued a ticket for speeding in a park zone did not receive a second ticket during the year, indicating they changed their behavior.” 
2. Second, policies related to speed camera violations have been changed over the years by the government after people complained about tickets they received, claiming violations were not legal.  For example, per [[Ref 3]](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/390000-drivers-set-to-receive-refunds-for-red-light-and-speed-camera-tickets/), around 390,000 drivers were set to receive refunds as a result of a lawsuit. In addition, removal of cameras at some locations, and change in policies regarding violation tickets to make the program more efficient, may also have contributed to decline in the number of tickets. 
3. Per Chicago Tribune [[Ref 4]](http://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago-speed-camera-tickets/cameras/4909-n-cicero-ave/), “the 146 cameras placed around 61 parks and schools have generated more than $81 million in tickets through Sept. 1, 2015.” Although more recent data on revenue earned could not be found, but it is clear that revenue earned through the speed camera program is a significant source of income that the City has planned to use for the causes mentioned above [[Ref 1]](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/automated_enforcement/news/2018/july/automated-speed-enforcement-cameras-to-be-activated-in-response-.html). The trendline and forecast curve also provides insights to the Mayor and his team that, with increased awareness and with improved efficiency with ticketing system, the revenue amount is supposed to decrease in future and the City should design its future policies regarding children’s safety program taking this trend into account.
